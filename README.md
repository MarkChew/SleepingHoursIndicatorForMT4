The aim of this indicator is to highlight which are your SLEEPING HOURS if you are a manual trader. 

When we create potential trading template files in the MT4 and if you are a manual trader ..... you might over estimate which signals you are able to take. 

With this indicator that I have wrote , manual traders are able to see which candles are highlighted in the sleeping hours.

Installation : 

Indicator to be placed in the indicator folder of your MT4 program

Usage : 

Drag and drop on chart 
 
To use on 4 hour charts and below..... 

Adjust the the hours to your own time zone settings. 
Adjust the highlight to your own favorite color and for color contrast

If the highlights go off the scale , just switch between timeframes and indicator will redraw. 

Enjoy !
